Full‑stack engineer in training, currently enrolled in Codecademy’s 27‑week instructor‑led bootcamp (Aug 2025 – Feb 2026).
I focus on building projects that are **clear, modular, and practical** — with an eye toward long‑term maintainability, but also a commitment to MVP style development for bigger impact.
